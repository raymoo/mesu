A note or interval is an Event

Time is some arbitrary Ord type used for representing time



data Event =
    Note
  | Interval Time


type ApproachingNotes = [(Time, Event)]


type ActiveNotes = Queue (Time, Event)


For each lane, keep a list of Time-Event pairings and a queue of Time-Event pairings.
The queue holds notes that are currently active (on the screen), and is sorted by time.
The list is also sorted by time, and holds notes that are not on the screen yet, but
are in the future.

Each frame, the front event of the queue is checked to see if it is still visible on
the screen. If it is a Note, the time is sufficient. If it's an Interval, the stored
end time is checked to see if it is in the game view. If the Event is no longer
visible, it can be removed from the queue, as it will never need to be handled again.
(the cutoff time might be a bit later, since you might want to be able to input a note
and get a bad score if you hit the key a bit later).
